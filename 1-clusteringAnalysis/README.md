## Pokémon Clustering Analysis

This project implements three clustering algorithms (K-Means, K-Medians, and K-Medoids) to analyze Pokémon data based on their base attack and defense stats.

## Features
K-Means Clustering: Euclidean distance-based clustering with centroid updates
K-Medians Clustering: Manhattan distance-based clustering with median updates
K-Medoids Clustering: Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm with actual data points as centers

Visualization: Interactive plots showing clustering progress at each iteration
Detailed Output: Step-by-step cluster assignment information for each Pokémon

## Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
SciPy

## Dataset
The analysis uses the Pokemon.csv dataset which should contain:

Pokémon names
Base Attack stats
Base Defense stats
